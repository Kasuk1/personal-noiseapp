# NoiseApp

This project was created to be part of my portfolio and will probably receive updates through my learning process. The requirements were self-assigned with basis in my daily learning.

Now I'm going to divide the entire process followed to the final result of this application. But before that, I will mention some important technologies used in the entire stack (This project start with Front-end objective, probably improved in the future through Back-end).

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JS
- SCSS
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- ReactRouter v5

## Process

Now I'm going to divide the entire process followed to the final result of this application.

### Wireframe

The [wireframing](https://www.figma.com/file/LUmoAiitPxxeCoy1ZmYgmO/Personal-Project---Noise?node-id=2%3A28) of this project was made in Figma and was useful to structure the components that will be used in the React project. Although you're going to realize that the aspect and structure will change in the prototype process and that's normal(at least with personal projects).

### Prototype

The [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/LUmoAiitPxxeCoy1ZmYgmO/Personal-Project---Noise?node-id=2%3A29) is medium-fidelity and was made in Figma as well. Does not contain neither animations nor functionality, but have a close approach to the final design to be implemented. The full prototype is not finished to all the views, and that's because the lack of knowledge from Spotify API. Will probably be updated but is not relevant at this point.

### Front-end

The app is based in React in collaboration with Redux to manage the state. The process to structure the initial files and folders is tough to me but I tried my best at this point and tried to avoid too much code in a single file as well.

The style was made with SCSS without any framework. The structure folder was implemented isolated just for the styles.

Another point is the loading state. With Redux was possible to tracked all the loading state when I made async requests and can have an state for the loaded and rejected state. The loading state's design was purely implemented with SCSS but this wasn't prepared in the wireframe process though. And it obvisuly exists libraries to render loading state friendly.

### Deployment

The app is deployed in [Netlify]().

## Future Work

I will probably implement a Back-end to this app, but before we need to think in something that have sens to be stored. It will be useful to my learning path though.

You can use this project as your will, but can't claimed as yours with the design base.
